Morse code
----------

Unassessed Learning Exercise Week 3
Steven Cheung & Martin Escardo

* The exercise is explained in the pdf file.

* Sample inputs with corresponding expected outputs are in
  TestCases.hs

  They are generated using our sample solution, which you will get
  after you submit.

  There won't be any test bench. Please test your program with the
  above, and also with your own tests.

* MorseLib.hs must be imported into your solution, which must be named
  morse.hs.

* Lectures that contain relevant material for this exercise are Data
  Types, prefixfreebittree (.hs and videos) and bittree.hs) and
  dicttree-handout.hs

In this exercise, although collaboration is not forbidden, you are
encouraged to work on your own as much as possible, to prepare
yourself well for the assessed exercise in Week 4, in which
collaboration is certainly not allowed.
